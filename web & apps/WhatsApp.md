# WhatsApp Privacy Settings

Tap on the 3 dots on top > Settings



## Account
- Two-step verification > Turn on > Create a secure PIN (`123456` or `098765` is not a secure PIN.)

> :information_source: **NOTE**: When asked for Email, make sure you provide an email which has adequate security measures like a strong password and 2FA enabled. Alternatively you can skip this, but then if you forget your PIN, you won't be able to re-register your phone number with WhatsApp.
