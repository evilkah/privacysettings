#### Security
- Save IP addresses in logs:
    If you suspect that someone else has access to your account, you can check your login activity from `Login > Active sessions` by enabling this. If you enable this, your IP addresses and the date & time of login will be captured. However, this also means your login IP address is kept permanently until you manually wipe the logs.
