## Security and privacy

#### Session management
- Revoke any old sessions which you don't use anymore.

#### Security logs
By default, Proton Mail keeps temporary IP logs to combat abuse and fraud. IP address may be retained permanently if you're engaged in activities that breach their terms and conditions (spamming, DDoS attacks against ProtonMail infrastructure, brute force attacks, etc.).

If you suspect that someone else has access to your account, you can check your login activity in the authentication logs by enabling this. If you enable advanced logs, your IP addresses and the date & time of login will be captured. However, this also means your login IP address is kept permanently until you manually wipe the logs.
